Instructions:


Before running the Simulink model, you must:

1) Make sure 'thresh.m' is somewhere on the MATLAB path (the current folder is fine).
2) Execute
    finalNets = shieldNN_design(2,0.23,pi/4,5,0.25,[0 0.25 0.5],10);
in MATLAB to generate the cell array 'finalNets' containing the ShieldNN networks.
